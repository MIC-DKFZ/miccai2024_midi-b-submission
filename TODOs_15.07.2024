- note down the rules that we see in the test data - Hamideh
- read studies on privacy and see if we are missing something in our rules: https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn53065760/wiki/627878 - Hamideh
- implement rules TCIA - Rajesh
- implement rules PS31.5 - Rajesh
- combine OCR, rules, dicom anonymizer (?) in the same algorithm 
- verify on the data we have (PHI test dataset) 
- evaluation method (either validation script given, or our own) - Stefan
- find out what the answer db is - Stefan

ADVANCED STEPS:
- try out other models than RoBERTa (LLM?)
- fine-tune LLM on the synthetic dataset

DEADLINES:
- implementation: 30.07.2024
- paper 4 pages: 29.08.2024
